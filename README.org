Per [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/52530/semantic-way-to-export-org-subtrees-inside-arbitrary-latex-environments/52538#52538][my quest to make LaTeX environments more semantic]] inside Org, here's a
quick export backend that links to my favored scribe class. This LaTeX class is
included with the repository.

This backend inherits much of its functionality from =ox-latex.el=.

** Distinctives
Right now, any text block enclosed within a drawer whose name is a registered
environment is wrapped inside that environment on export. A =:proof:= drawer
becomes a =proof= environment. This isn't truly ideal; I would like the more
flexible tag-based implementation that I mention in the question -- and that the
Beamer export backend uses.
