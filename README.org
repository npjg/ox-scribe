Per [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/52530/semantic-way-to-export-org-subtrees-inside-arbitrary-latex-environments/52538#52538][my quest to make LaTeX environments more semantic]] inside Org, here's a
quick export backend that links to my favored scribe class. This LaTeX class is
included with the repository.

This backend inherits much of its functionality from =ox-latex.el=.

** Distinctives
Beamer allows headlines to be specified as environments, and I am implementing a
similar system for common scribe-like environments.

For instance, consider the following Org document.
#+begin_src org
  ,* Cosets
  ,** Lagrange's Theorem                                            :S_theorem:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :SCRIBE_env: theorem
  :END:
  If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $|H|\mid|G|$.
  ,** Proof                                                           :S_proof:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :SCRIBE_env: proof
  :END:

  Let $a_1H, a_2H, \cdots, a_rH$ denote the left cosets of $H$ in $G$...
#+end_src

In an =ox-scribe= export, this produces the following LateX:
#+begin_src latex
  \section{Cosets}
  \begin{theorem}[Lagrange's Theorem]
    If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then $|H|\mid|G|$.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}[Proof]
    Let $a_1H, a_2H, \cdots, a_rH$ denote the left cosets of $H$ in $G$...
  \end{proof}
#+end_src

** Functionality
This package provides a minor mode for keeping properties and tags synchronized,
just like the minor mode provided with Beamer.
